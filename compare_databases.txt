# DATABASE COMPARISON INSTRUCTIONS

## The Simplest Way (Manual but Reliable)

### In Feb 7th Restored Database:
Run each of these queries ONE AT A TIME and note the count:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM projects;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM music;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM videos;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM publications;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM app_prototypes;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM orders;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM order_items;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM client_projects;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_profiles;
```

Write down each result like:
- projects: 3
- music: 3  
- videos: 5
- etc.

### In Current Database:
Run the EXACT SAME queries and write down the counts.

### Compare:
Look for differences. Any table where Feb 7th has MORE rows than current = data loss.

## Alternative: List All Tables First

If you want to see what tables exist, run this first:

```sql
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
ORDER BY table_name;
```

This shows you all tables in the database.
