# Attraction Campaigns — Promotional Offers

Use this section to answer questions like "Do you have any special offers?", "Are there any promotions?", "Can I get my money back?", or "What guarantees do you offer?"

## What Are Attraction Campaigns?

AmaduTown periodically runs **Attraction Campaigns** — special promotional offers where clients can earn back their investment by meeting specific criteria after purchasing an eligible program.

Campaign types include:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Money Back | Meet all criteria and receive a full or partial refund |
| Credit | Earn store credit toward future purchases |
| Rollover | Roll your investment into a higher-tier program |
| Hybrid | A combination of the above payout options |

## How It Works

1. **Take the AI Audit** — Complete the free AI & Audit Calculator at https://amadutown.com/tools/audit (or have an equivalent assessment done during a discovery call). This is required to personalize your success criteria.
2. **Purchase an eligible program** — Buy one of the qualifying bundles listed on the pricing page (https://amadutown.com/pricing). You will be automatically enrolled in the campaign.
3. **Meet your criteria** — Each enrolled client receives personalized success criteria based on their audit results. Progress is tracked automatically where possible, or you can submit evidence manually via your client dashboard.
4. **Earn your payout** — Once all criteria are met, choose your preferred payout (refund, credit, or rollover depending on the campaign) and the team will process it.

## How to Answer Campaign Questions

- If a visitor asks about promotions, special offers, or guarantees, check if there are active campaigns on the homepage (https://amadutown.com) or direct them to the pricing page.
- Emphasize that campaigns are time-limited and have specific eligibility requirements.
- Recommend taking the free AI Audit as a first step, since it is a prerequisite for enrollment.
- Suggest booking a discovery call to discuss which program and campaign is the best fit: https://calendly.com/amadutown/atas-discovery-call
- For specific campaign details (criteria, deadlines, eligible programs), direct users to the campaign page on the homepage or the individual campaign landing page.

## Important Notes

- Not all programs are eligible for every campaign — eligibility depends on which bundles the campaign covers.
- Criteria are personalized based on the client's business context (from the audit or discovery call).
- Progress tracking may be automatic (based on onboarding milestones, dashboard activity) or manual (client submits evidence).
- Campaigns have start and end dates — clients must purchase during the active period to enroll.
