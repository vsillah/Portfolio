# Amadutown Pricing Model

> Based on Alex Hormozi's $100M Offers framework. Last updated: 2026-02-13.

## Value Equation

```
VALUE = (Dream Outcome × Perceived Likelihood) ÷ (Time Delay × Effort & Sacrifice)
```

Every pricing element maps to this equation:

- **Dream Outcome**: Quantified via value calculations (annual savings, revenue gained)
- **Perceived Likelihood**: Increased via guarantees, case studies, diagnostic evidence
- **Time Delay**: Reduced by deploying actual tools (not just advice)
- **Effort & Sacrifice**: Reduced by done-for-you and done-with-you delivery
