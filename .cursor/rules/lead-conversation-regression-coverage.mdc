# Lead/Conversation Regression Coverage

Use this rule when fixing bugs in lead pipeline or sales conversation flows.

Before closing a fix, do one of the following:

1. add/update an E2E simulator scenario for the fixed path, or
2. add a tracked TODO with owner/date in the simulator plan for follow-up coverage

## Required Reference

- `.cursor/plans/e2e_client_simulator_tool_acd6dda4.plan.md`

## Guardrail

Do not mark the incident done without explicit regression coverage action.
