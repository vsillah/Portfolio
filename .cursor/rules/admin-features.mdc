# Admin Feature Development Guidelines

When creating new admin functionality (pages, dashboards, tools) under `/app/admin/`, you MUST complete ALL of the following steps:

## Required Checklist

### 1. Create the Admin Page
- Create the page at `app/admin/{feature}/page.tsx`
- Use the existing admin UI patterns (dark theme, gradient cards, etc.)
- Wrap with `<ProtectedRoute requireAdmin>` for access control

### 2. Add Navigation to Admin Sidebar and (Optional) Dashboard
**CRITICAL: This step is mandatory and must not be skipped.**

Admin navigation is driven by a **persistent left sidebar** (see `components/admin/AdminSidebar.tsx`). The nav tree is defined in **`lib/admin-nav.ts`**.

- **Add your new page to the sidebar:** Edit `lib/admin-nav.ts` and add an entry under the appropriate category’s `items` (or under `children` for Content Hub sub-pages). Categories: Pipeline, Sales, Post-sale, Quality & insights, Configuration.
- **Dashboard home** (`app/admin/page.tsx`) shows category-snapshot cards with feeds. If the new feature is a primary destination (e.g. a new top-level hub), consider adding a card or feed for it in the matching category; otherwise the sidebar link is sufficient for discovery.

### 3. Update Any Relevant Documentation
- If the feature requires setup (database schema, env vars, etc.), document it
- Update README or create a setup guide if needed

## Color Palette for Admin Cards

Use these gradient combinations for consistency:
- **Chat/Communication**: amber → orange
- **Analytics/Data**: purple → pink  
- **Content/Settings**: blue → cyan
- **Users/Management**: green → teal
- **System/Config**: cyan → blue
- **Sales/Revenue**: emerald → teal
- **Testing/QA**: rose → red
- **Alerts/Warnings**: yellow → orange

## Plan Template

When planning new admin features, include this section:

```
### Admin Dashboard Integration
- [ ] Add entry to `lib/admin-nav.ts` in the correct category (items or Content children)
- [ ] If a primary hub: add or extend a dashboard category card/feed in `app/admin/page.tsx`
```

## Why This Matters

Admin features that aren’t in the sidebar are hard to discover. The sidebar is the single source of truth; the dashboard home provides a snapshot and quick links. Users expect to reach all admin functionality from the sidebar or from the dashboard category cards.
