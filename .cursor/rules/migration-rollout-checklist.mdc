# Migration Rollout Checklist

Use this rule for migrations tied to API/UI behavior.

Every schema-coupled change summary must include:

- required migration files
- explicit apply order
- which runtime paths depend on each migration
- rollback/fallback note if migration is delayed

## Guardrail

If API code assumes new columns/tables, do not present task as complete without calling out migration dependency.

## Execution Verification

Before committing migration files:

1. Apply each migration to a development database (e.g. `supabase db push` or `psql -f`).
2. Confirm the migration succeeds without errors.
3. Verify new tables/columns exist with a quick query (e.g. `\dt` or `SELECT * FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = '...'`).
4. If migrations have ordering dependencies, apply them in the documented order and confirm each step.

A migration that has not been executed against a real database is untested code.
