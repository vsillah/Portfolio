# Migration Rollout Checklist

Use this rule for migrations tied to API/UI behavior.

Every schema-coupled change summary must include:

- required migration files
- explicit apply order
- which runtime paths depend on each migration
- rollback/fallback note if migration is delayed

## Guardrail

If API code assumes new columns/tables, do not present task as complete without calling out migration dependency.
