# Inline Type Checking

After creating or substantially editing a TypeScript file, run `ReadLints` on that file **before moving to the next file**. This catches type errors (implicit any, missing imports, wrong signatures) at the point of authorship rather than deferring them to the final `npm run build`.

## When to check

- After creating a new `.ts` or `.tsx` file.
- After adding a new function signature, type, or interface that other files will consume.
- After editing a shared lib file that API routes or components import.

## What to look for

- `noImplicitAny` violations (callback parameters, destructured objects).
- Missing imports or unresolved modules.
- Type mismatches at function boundaries.

## Why

Deferred type checking creates a batch of errors at the end of a session. Fixing them in bulk is slower, riskier, and harder to attribute to specific changes.
