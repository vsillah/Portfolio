# n8n Credential Creation — Be Explicit

When instructing the user to create or reconnect a credential in n8n:

## 1. State the exact credential type name

Use the exact name as it appears in the n8n credential type selector.

- **Good:** "Select **Gmail OAuth2** (the one labeled 'Gmail OAuth2 API')"
- **Bad:** "Create a Gmail credential" or "Create a Google credential"

n8n lists many Google-related credential types (Google OAuth2, Google Drive OAuth2, Gmail OAuth2, Google Sheets OAuth2, etc.). Users will pick the wrong one if the instruction is vague.

## 2. Include a verification step after creation

After the user creates the credential, ask them to confirm:

- "The credential dialog header should say **'Gmail OAuth2 API'** (or whichever type). If it says something else (e.g. 'Google Drive OAuth2 API'), delete it and create the correct type."

## 3. Include a sign-in confirmation step

After the OAuth sign-in flow:

- Ask: "Do you see **'Account connected'** (with a green checkmark) in the n8n credential dialog?"
- Do NOT assume the credential is ready until the user explicitly confirms the "Account connected" state.
- If the user's response is ambiguous (e.g. "done", "ok", "finally"), ask specifically: "Did you see 'Account connected' in the credential dialog?"

## 4. Save reminder

After confirming "Account connected":

- Remind the user to click **Save** on the credential dialog before closing it.

## Why

- Wrong credential type: costs ~10-15 minutes to diagnose (user creates Google Drive OAuth2 instead of Gmail OAuth2, node fails with auth errors that look like token issues).
- Incomplete OAuth flow: costs ~5 minutes per failed test run (user acknowledges the step but hasn't actually completed the sign-in).
- Unsaved credential: token is lost when the dialog closes.

## Reference

- Incident: 2026-02-13 — User created Google Drive OAuth2 instead of Gmail OAuth2 when instructed to "create a Gmail credential." Required screenshots to diagnose.
