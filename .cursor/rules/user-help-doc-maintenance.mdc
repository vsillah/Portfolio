# User Help Guide — Update After Build

After a successful build that introduces or modifies **user-facing functionality**, review and update the user help guide:

**Help doc location:** `docs/user-help-guide.md`
**Help page route:** `/help`

## When to update

Update the help doc when the build includes any of the following:

- **New user-facing pages or routes** (store, services, checkout, proposals, onboarding, etc.).
- **New or changed navigation entries** or user flows (menu items, links, breadcrumbs).
- **Changes to cart, checkout, payment, or order lifecycle** (new steps, changed flows, new payment methods).
- **New product or service types** or changes to filter/search options.
- **Changes to account features** (login, signup, user menu items, OAuth providers).
- **New lead magnet types or download flows**.
- **Changes to proposal or onboarding structure** (new sections, changed statuses, new actions).
- **New or changed discount/referral/sharing features**.

## What to update

1. **Relevant section** — Add or revise the section describing the changed feature.
2. **Table of Contents** — Add new section links if a new section was created.
3. **FAQ / Troubleshooting** — Add entries if the change introduces new edge cases or common questions.
4. **Tables** — Update any feature/type tables (product types, service types, proposal statuses, etc.) if values changed.

## How to update

- Keep the existing section structure and numbering intact.
- Add new content inline where it fits; do not reorganize unless the user asks.
- Use the same formatting conventions (tables, blockquotes, bold field names).

## What NOT to update

- Internal refactors, admin-only changes, style-only tweaks, or test-only changes with no user-facing impact.
- Do not remove existing content unless it describes behavior that has been explicitly replaced or removed.

## Verification

After updating, confirm:
- The help doc still renders correctly via `/help`.
- New routes or features mentioned in the doc match the actual codebase.
- Links within the doc (anchor links, etc.) are valid.
