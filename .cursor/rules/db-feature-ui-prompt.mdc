# Database Feature → UI Prompt

When **planning** or **designing** a feature that introduces changes in the database (new tables, columns, migrations, or new API surfaces backed by the DB):

1. **Before finalizing the plan**, ask the user explicitly:
   - *"Should this [table/column/feature] also be introduced in the UI layer?"*
   - Or: *"Do you want this exposed in the admin (or user) UI, or backend/API only for now?"*

2. **Scope of "introduced in the UI"** includes:
   - New or updated admin pages/screens that read or write the new data
   - New list/detail views, forms, or filters that use the new schema
   - User-facing screens or flows that depend on the new data

3. **When to ask**
   - During plan/design discussions that add or change database schema or API responses.
   - Not required when the user has already stated UI scope (e.g. "add a new admin page for X") or when the task is explicitly backend-only.

4. **Keep it one question**
   - One clear prompt is enough; do not repeat if the user has already answered or deferred.
