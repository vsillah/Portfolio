This repository follows a multi-app, feature-driven architecture.

Top-level rule:
- Treat each folder under /apps as an independent application boundary.
- Never mix frontend and backend concerns.
/apps/backend
- Contains backend-only code (APIs, services, data access).
- No frontend imports or UI concepts allowed.

/apps/frontend
- Contains all client-side code.
- No backend logic or persistence code allowed.
/apps/frontend/assets
- Static files only (images, fonts, icons)
- Never place logic or components here

/apps/frontend/src
- All executable frontend code lives here
/src/components
- Reusable, presentational building blocks
- No routing logic
- No Redux access unless explicitly passed as props
- No awareness of user flow (auth, onboarding, checkout, etc.)

/src/screens
- Feature- or journey-oriented containers
- Represents "pages" or "flows" in the application
- Screens compose components and connect to Redux
Rule of thumb for Cursor:

If the code represents what the user is doing, it belongs in screens.
If it represents how something looks or behaves generically, it belongs in components.
/src/screens/*
- Each subfolder represents a user-facing feature or flow
- Examples: auth, main, onboarding, profile

Inside each screen folder:
- index.tsx (or equivalent entry file)
- feature-specific subcomponents
- feature-specific hooks or helpers
Cursor should create new screen folders when a feature introduces:

a new user journey

a new navigation entry

a new authentication or authorization boundary
/src/redux
- Global application state only

/redux/actions
- Action creators only
- No reducer logic

/redux/reducers
- Reducers only
- No side effects
Cursor should not:

Create Redux logic inside screens or components

Duplicate Redux state per feature unless instructed

If feature-level state is needed, ask:

"Should this be global Redux state or local screen state?"
/src/tests
- Tests should mirror the structure of src
- Prefer colocated test folders for screens and critical logic
- Naming convention: *.test.ts(x)
Cursor should:

Place tests close to the feature they validate

Avoid dumping all tests into a single flat directory
/src/libs
- External integrations
- Wrappers around third-party libraries
- Code that could be reused across apps in the future

/utils (if introduced)
- Small pure helper functions
- No side effects
If Cursor is unsure whether something is a lib or a component, it must ask.

/design-files
- Design references only (Figma exports, mocks, diagrams)
- Never import from this folder in production code
- Use for visual or UX context only
Cursor may reference design intent but must never generate runtime dependencies on this folder.
README.md defines:
- App responsibilities
- Folder intent
- Architectural constraints

Cursor must treat README as authoritative.
If a change violates README assumptions, ask before proceeding.
