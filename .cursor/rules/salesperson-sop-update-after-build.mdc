# Salesperson SOP — Update After Build

After a successful build that introduces or modifies **sales-facing functionality**, review and update the salesperson SOP:

**SOP location:** `docs/admin-sales-lead-pipeline-sop.md`

## When to update

Update the SOP when the build includes any of the following:

- **New admin pages or routes** in the sales, leads, proposals, bundles, scripts, or client-projects areas.
- **New or changed API endpoints** that admin/sales associates interact with (directly or via UI).
- **New sales flows or entry points** (e.g. new ways to start a conversation, new proposal types, new checkout paths).
- **Changes to offer roles, payout types, or pricing models** (e.g. adding guarantee rollover options, continuity plans).
- **New or changed webhook behavior** that affects post-sale lifecycle (payment, onboarding, milestones, subscriptions).
- **New admin tools** (dashboards, configuration screens, evaluation tools).
- **Changes to the data model** that affect what admin inputs or sees (new fields, renamed statuses, new tables surfaced in the UI).
- **New inbound lead channels** or changes to existing ones (contact form, chat, voice, diagnostic).

## What to update

1. **Process diagram** (Section 2) — Add new subgraphs, nodes, or connections if the flow changed.
2. **Data input table** (Section 3) — Add new input fields or screens where admin enters data.
3. **Behind-the-scenes sections** (Sections 4–6) — Update pipeline, sales, or proposal mechanics.
4. **Sales asset configuration** (Section 7) — Add new asset types or classification options.
5. **Post-sale lifecycle** (Section 10) — Update payment, onboarding, or milestone flows.
6. **Workflow reference table** (Section 12) — Add new workflows or update triggers/inputs/outputs.
7. **Human-in-the-loop summary** (Section 13) — Add new admin actions or client-visible outcomes.
8. **Quick reference** (Section 17) — Add new admin or client-facing routes.

## How to update

- Keep the existing structure and section numbering intact.
- Add new content inline where it fits; do not reorganize unless the user asks.
- Use the same formatting conventions (tables, mermaid diagrams, bold field names).
- If a new feature is large enough to warrant its own section, add it after the last numbered section and update the quick reference.

## What NOT to update

- Do not update the SOP for internal refactors, style changes, or test-only changes that have no user-facing or admin-facing impact.
- Do not remove existing content unless it describes behavior that has been explicitly replaced or removed.

## Verification

After updating, confirm:
- The mermaid diagram still renders correctly (no syntax errors).
- New routes mentioned in the SOP match the actual routes in the codebase.
- New env var names (if any) are listed in the quick reference section.
