# Debug Instrumentation Cleanup

When you add **temporary** debug instrumentation to investigate or verify behavior, remove it before considering the task complete.

## What counts as temporary instrumentation

- `// #region agent log` / `// #endregion` blocks that send to a debug ingest URL (e.g. `http://127.0.0.1:7242/ingest/...`) or write to a debug log
- `console.log` (or similar) with `[DEBUG]` or hypothesis IDs used only for one-off debugging
- Writing to or relying on `.cursor/debug.log` or other one-off log files for evidence

## Before finishing a debugging or “fix and verify” task

1. Search the changed (or relevant) files for: `#region agent log`, `127.0.0.1:7242`, `[DEBUG]`, and any debug log file path you introduced.
2. Remove all such instrumentation (and delete any temporary debug log file) unless the user explicitly asked to keep it.
3. Do not leave `#region agent log` blocks or fetch calls to local debug ingest URLs in committed code.

## When instrumentation is intentional

If the user asks to add persistent logging, observability, or a permanent debug endpoint, that is not “temporary instrumentation” and should not be removed by this rule.
