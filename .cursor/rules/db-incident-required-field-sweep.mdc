# Required-Field Sweep

Use this rule during DB incident resolution.

After fixing the first DB/runtime error, proactively sweep the same flow for:

- other NOT NULL columns not being populated
- missing columns referenced by SELECT/INSERT/UPDATE
- check constraints on candidate values
- required relationship fields (FKs)

## Exit Criteria

Before closing the incident, confirm:

1. create/read/update path succeeds end-to-end
2. no next-likely schema error remains in the same flow
